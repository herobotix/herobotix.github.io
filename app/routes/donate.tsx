            <h2>Extra Curricular Activity (ECA) Tax Credits for Arizona Residents</h2>
            <div>
            <p className={"intro"}>Under A.R.S. ยง43-1089.01, an individual may claim a <u>nonrefundable tax credit</u> for making cash contributions to a public school located in Arizona for the support of extracurricular activities.	If a taxpayer has at least as much tax liability as their ECA donation, the donation is essentially a free donation.</p>
            <h3>As an Arizona Resident, you can:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Donate up to $200 per individual tax return or $400 per joint tax return by using your ECA tax credit.</li>
                <li>Forward this web address (<a href="http://www.herobotix.com/donate">herobitix.com/donate</a>) to friends and family who reside in Arizona who can also participate in this tax credit option.	They can check out as a guest, so a MySchoolBucks account is NOT required.</li>
            </ol>
